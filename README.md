- Hi, I’m Teg Louis (legally Thomas E. Gagen), @teglouis27
- I’m interested in automation, mathematics, statistics, and chloropleths.
- I’m currently learning JavaScript, Erlang, and GoLang.
- I’m looking to collaborate on romogi.com. It will be a website/desktop application for an animated chloropleth for all administrative regions,
  for which a GUI will allow users to easily query and make chloropleth presentations.
- You can reach me at: libfree54@gmail.com with the heading: "ANIMATED CHLOROPLETHS".
